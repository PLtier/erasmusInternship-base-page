# Ultra basic Gatsby & Netlify CMS Starter
Sharing since I thought it would be useful for some people. This starter got rid of many features from [original starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) while main functions remained. *Great for getting familiar with core concepts without being dismayed by myriad of files.*
## Differences compared to the original one.
- removed tags
- added top image to every blog post
- added image carousel in index page. **Images were made editable within CMS**
- removed all pages except for index page.

**Reading the README.md and prerequisites from [Github/Gatsby-Starter-Netlify-CMS](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) is must-have so as to start working with this template.**
